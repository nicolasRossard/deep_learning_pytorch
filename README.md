# Deep learning with Pytorch

Create Convolutional Neuronal Network and run it with PyTorch. 
Use dataset from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/rhammell/ships-in-satellite-imagery

Each version made are saved
## Version 3:
Run a CNN on dataset, print some predictions

To execute:

Download kaggle shipsnet.json and save into datas/ ==> datas/shipsnet.json

$ python3 ship_v3.py

## Version 4:
Download dataset from Kaggle

Clean dataset

Save dataset into Minio

Load dataset from Minio

Check if datasets are equals

Create CNN

Train model

Display some samples

To execute:

$ python3 main_v4.py

## Version 5:
Execute several CNN with differents parameters, save performances into a pandas DataFrame, keep the best Model and the best Optimizer. Save all files in local

To execute:

$ python3 main_v5.py
